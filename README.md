# Scope
This Laravel code appears to be a part of a booking system, likely for a translation service. Here are some thoughts on the code:

### What's Good: 
###### Namespacing and Use Statements: 
The code uses namespaces and "use" statements effectively, which helps in organizing and managing classes.

###### Dependency Injection: 
Dependency injection is used appropriately, making the code more testable and decoupled.

###### Controller Methods: 
The methods in the controller are well-segmented and seem to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, which is a good practice.

###### Error Handling: 
The code has some basic error handling in place, which is a good start. For example, in the resendSMSNotifications method.

###### Comments: 
The code includes docblock comments which provide some information about the purpose of each method.

#### What Could Be Improved: 
###### Use of Magic Strings: 
There are a few instances where magic strings are used (e.g., 'user_id', 'adminemail', 'distance', etc.). It would be better to use constants or configuration files for these values to make the code more maintainable.

###### Lack of Validation: 
It appears there's limited input validation. More validation could be added to ensure that the incoming data is in the expected format.

###### Error Handling: While there is some error handling, it might be beneficial to include more robust error handling and potentially use Laravel's built-in exception handling mechanisms.

###### Consistent Return Types: Some methods return a response, while others return null. It would be better to have consistent return types.

###### Direct Configuration Access: Directly accessing the environment variables like env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID') could be improved by using Laravel's configuration system.

###### Potentially Redundant Code: There are a few instances where conditional checks could potentially be simplified or refactored for readability.

###### Code Duplication: There may be some opportunities to refactor and reuse common pieces of code.

## Overall: 
The code is well-organized and follows Laravel conventions, but there's room for improvement, especially in terms of input validation, error handling, and making use of Laravel's features like configuration and exception handling. Additionally, considering using constants or configuration files for values that are used multiple times.

## Updates: 
I have provided a refactored version of the code with some improvements. Please note that this is just one possible way to refactor the code, and there are often multiple valid approaches.

###### Changes in BookingController

1. Too many line spaces - I have removed that
2. Removed unused imports
3. Removed unused variables and conditions
4. Removed Redundant if else conditions
5. In the distanceFeed - data should return so i added a structure

###### Changes in BookingRepository

1. Too many line spaces - I have removed that
2. Too many else if code - which makes code redundant and hard to read,
3. it feels like things that we can easily solve with laravel validation package - they use if else for it
4. create a general function to be used
5. update few long if else conditions
6. Removed commented code if not needed and unused code
7. code feels like a mix code of a junior and a senior both - coding pattern of return statement is mix
8. removed non-reachable statements
